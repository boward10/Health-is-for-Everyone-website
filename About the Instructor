I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience and psychology at Baldwin-Wallace University, where I learned about leadership models and institutionalized inequities. I completed my Master of Public Health degree at Emory University with a focus the socio-contextual determinants of health, specifically rural health.

I am currently completing a Doctor of Public Health Degree for working professionals at Georgia State University.

I was inspired to become a health equity advocate by my rural roots. I grew up as the seventh generation on a family farm in Appalachian Ohio, milking cows, planting and harvesting crops, and working physically hard to help my family and neighbors survive.

I have lived the insults suffered by Appalachian communities. I understand the history or natural resource depletion and labor exploitation in Appalachia because my father was a coal miner and then an oilfield worker before joining his father and grandfather in farming.

I understand the devastation caused by lack of medical care and health resources in Appalachia because my older sister died secondary to poorly managed epilepsy treatment. My hometown and people I love are caught in the scourge of the opioid epidemic following the collapse of blue-collar industries. I have experienced the agony of being forced to sell our milking cows when the price of produce dropped so low that the cost of milking exceeded my familyâ€™s humble income. I understand the anger and distrust of government that continue to frustrate well-intentioned efforts to help rural and Appalachian communities.

I believe that all sustainable community development must be rooted within that community. I want other people to understand that the only way to change inequitable power structures is through teamwork. It should not matter what someone looks like, where they are from, or how much money they have. Everyone deserves a fair chance to be happy and healthy.
