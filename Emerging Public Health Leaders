<p>Emerging public health professionals must work to reduce geopolitical divisions and disparities. They must understand differences in geopolitical health determinants and their drivers, be experts at assessing and addressing the needs of diverse communities and engage in continual self-reflection to avoid perpetuating geo-political divisions that could stymie efforts to reduce disparities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Public health professionals must support health and prosperity for all, regardless of differences in race, class, gender, sex, political ideology, culture, social values, age, region, religion, and/or creed.</p>

<h1>Evidence</h1>
<p>Ample studies have shown that rural areas often have many health disparities resulting in greater mortality and shorter life spans than urban counterparts. The need to reduce disparities is evident. The following sources offer suggestions on methods for decreasing rural health disparities as related to the emerging workforce and students.

<p>Key Evidence of Need for Additional Resources in Rural Areas:</p>
<p>Abstract: "<em>SCOPE OF PROBLEM</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Educational and community-based programs was virtually tied for sixth place with four other focus areas as a top rural health priority area.1</em></li>
<li><em>School, worksite, health facility, and community-based health education, prevention, and intervention programs are able to access large segments of the population; however, these programs may be less prevalent in rural than urban settings</em></li>
<li><em>According to a 1994 report, only 28 percent of school districts meet the recommended standard of one school nurse per 750 students. School nurses in rural areas are often responsible for schools that are many miles apart.2</em></li>
<li><em>Smaller employers—the mainstay of rural economies—are less likely than larger employers to offer health promotion and disease prevention programs.3-5</em></li>
<li><em>Rural areas may lack the readiness, resources, and technical expertise necessary to develop successful and sustainable educational and community-based programs"</em></li>

<div>Abstract: <em>"Compared to their urban counterparts, rural and remote inhabitants experience lower life expectancy and poorer health status. Nowhere is the worldwide shortage of health professionals more pronounced than in rural areas of developing countries. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) includes a disproportionately large number of developing countries; therefore, this article explores SSA in depth as an example. Using the conceptual framework of access to primary health care, sustainable rural health service models, rural health workforce supply, and policy implications, this article presents a review of the academic and gray literature as the basis for recommendations designed to achieve greater health equity. An alternative international standard for health professional education is recommended. Decision makers should draw upon the expertise of communities to identify community-specific health priorities and should build capacity to enable the recruitment and training of local students from underserviced areas to deliver quality health care in rural community settings."</em></div>

<p>Abstract: <em>"Approximately 20 percent of the US total population lives in rural areas. Patients living in rural areas are often underserved with regard to healthcare access. The complexity of rural healthcare provision requires careful and systematic evaluation of individual contributing factors. The purpose of this review is to examine the current literature quantifying current and projected health provider need, to explore geographic provider choices, to synthesize evidence on interventions to increase rural provider recruitment and provider retention, and to document the efficacy of student training for current rural healthcare in the US."</em></p>

<p>Key Strategy Highlighted in Manuscript for Improving Rural Health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop distance learning training options for professional development, especially for members of the health workforce</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract: <em>"Background: Allied health professionals working in rural areas face unique challenges, often with limited access to resources. Accessing continuing professional development is one of those challenges and is related to retention of workforce. Effectiveness of distance learning strategies for continuing professional development in rural allied healthcare workers has not been evaluated.</em></p>
<p class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading"><em>Methods: We searched 17 databases and the grey literature up to September 2016 following the PRISMA guidelines. Any primary studies were included that focused on allied health and distance delivery regardless of education topic or study design. Two independent reviewers extracted data and critically appraised the selected studies.</em></p>
<p class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading"><em>Results:&nbsp;The search returned 5257 results. With removal of duplicate references, we reviewed 3964 article titles and abstracts;&nbsp;n =&nbsp;206 appeared potentially eligible and were scrutinized via full text screening;&nbsp;n =&nbsp;14 were included. Studies were published between 1997 and 2016, were of varied methodological quality and were predominantly from Australia, USA and Canada with a focus on satisfaction of learners with the delivery method or on measures of educational outcomes. Technologies used to deliver distance education included video conference, teleconference, web-based platforms and virtual reality. Early papers tended to focus more on the technology characteristics than educational outcomes. Some studies compared technology based delivery to face to face modes and found satisfaction and learning outcomes to be on par. Only three studies reported on practice change following the educational intervention and, despite a suggestion there is a link between the constructs, none measured the relationship between access to continuing professional development and workforce retention.</em></p>
<p class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading"><em>Conclusion: Technology based options of delivery have a high utility, however the complex inter-relatedness of time, use, travel, location, costs, interactivity, learning outcomes and educational design suggest a need for more sophisticated consideration by educational providers."</em></p>

<p>Abstract: <em>"Thrive Rural is an ambitious effort to create a shared framework and understanding about what it will take for communities and Native nations across the rural United States to be healthy places where everyone belongs, lives with dignity, and thrives. This field scan is a contribution to Thrive Rural, specifically intended to provide an understanding of the state of relevant health fields in the United States, namely public health and health care. It is a complement to the parallel scan of rural development field practice and trends, released simultaneously. This scan aims to address the overarching question: What are the potential pathways of influence for public health and health care to foster more prosperous, equitable and sustainable communities across rural America? Through an expedited systematic review, this scan draws from practice literature in the public health and health care fields on their current state and evolution, including literature that captures convenings and agenda-setting among field leaders. Key informant conversations were conducted with select field leaders in public health and health care to complement existing research and documentation. This scan begins with background on the fields of public health and health care, and an overview of prevailing theories and frameworks that guide practice in these fields. That leads to a synthesis of current field trends and change strategies across public health and health care, and the scan concludes with findings on drivers, or levers, for change that can influence trends and change strategies within and across fields."</em>&nbsp;</p>
