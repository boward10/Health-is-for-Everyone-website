<h2><strong>Relevance of Program</strong></h2>
<p>There is a widening gap in the health of people living in rural and urban areas. <sup>1-3</sup> Rural populations are often in lower socio-economic strata, older, have higher smoking rates, higher blood pressure, and higher rates of obesity compared to urban populations.<sup>1</sup> The mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, and stroke are higher among people in rural than urban areas.<sup>2,3</sup> Although approximately 63% of US counties are rural, only about 15% of the US population lives in rural areas.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; Drivers of rural/urban health disparities include differences in access to and affordability of healthcare, different behavioral patterns and lifestyles, cultural influences on health, and the environment.<sup>5</sup> While no population is homogenous, there is a tendency for people living in geographical communities to share similarities in culture and values. According to the National Center for Health Statistics’ analysis of registered voters by county, in 2017, urban counties were 62% Democrat (31% Republican) while rural counties were 54% Republican (38% Democrat).<sup>6</sup> The overlay of political affiliation with health disparities is not coincidental. In concert with differing social determinants and drivers of disparities between communities, differing values and conformity to the values of ones’ community<sup>7</sup> help explain divisions among rural and urban populations. Public health professionals must work closely with policymakers and the public to reduce geo-political divisions and disparities. Public health professionals must be knowledgeable about evidence-based methods for improving rural health and be experts at assessing and addressing the needs of diverse communities. Public health professionals have an obligation to support health and prosperity for all, regardless of differences in race, class, gender, sex, political ideology, culture, social values, age, region, religion, and/or creed.</p>
<h2><strong>Description of Online Training: </strong></h2>
<p>This 10-week training is designed to engage community-based professionals (i.e., governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, public institutions) in evidence-based and culturally sensitive methods for overcoming challenges with integrating into rural communities and improving health and wellbeing of rural populations.</p>
<h2><strong>Focus Audiences: </strong></h2>
<p>Professionals may belong to any organization and may work at the local, state, or national level(s). Professionals from single organizations should enroll in groups of 3-5, to ensure multiple perspectives and share responsibility for planning community activities. There is no limit on the number of groups or organizations eligible to take the training. Examples of individuals and organizations who may benefit from this program include law enforcement, civic organizations, schools, government leaders, media, researchers, and other organizations that may influence health and/or community wellbeing. The following graphics provide additional examples (Sector Maps from class on 3.23.22 PowerPoint “Developing Health Education to Influence Decisions/Policy &amp; the Public” for PH9320, Spring 2022, Dr. S. Strasser).</p>

<h2><strong>Time Requirement</strong>:</h2>
<p>During the 10-week training, learners must commit approximately one hour per week to reviewing online lectures and engaging in synchronous online activities. Additional time (approximately 10-20 hours) will be needed to complete recommended self-directed learning activities over the 10-week program. Supplemental modules are available to support work on specific topics related to rural health.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Course Modality/Format</strong>:</h2>
<p>This training will be held online (Zoom), using a combination of pre-recorded online lectures, live sessions, discussions, readings, videos, assignments, and learning assessments</p>
<h2><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></h2>
<p>After completing all course sessions, learners will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe understanding of multiple methods for successfully integrating into new communities while demonstrating cultural sensitivity</li>
<li>Be able to utilize focus groups, community discussion forums, and key stakeholder interviews to understand the needs and values of communities</li>
<li>Understand key issues facing rural communities and be able to adapt existing evidence-based solutions to these issues to individual communities</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Pedagogical/Andragogical Methods Integrated Within this Course:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate why community-based public health (PH) professionals need to learn about working in rural communities</li>
<li>Promote cross-sector collaboration, PH workforce group learning, and developing relationships with fellow PH colleagues and community leaders invested in decreasing geopolitical disparities</li>
<li>Create an environment where PH professionals can learn from one another’s rich knowledge and experiences</li>
<li>Empower PH professionals unfamiliar with working in rural communities to do so with cultural sensitivity and avoid potential pitfalls</li>
<li>Provide a variety of learning style opportunities including:
<ul>
<li>Self-Directed: Learners will be assigned to read about and complete independent reflection activities to enhance their understanding of the topics</li>
<li>Transformational Learning: Use dilemmas and situations to challenge learners’ perceptions about rural and urban populations</li>
<li>Discussion Groups: Shared reflection topics and writing prompts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Methods to Assess Impact and Determine Knowledge and Learning Needs:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Prior to foundational area learning, assess current knowledge using web-based surveys</li>
<li>Following the learning course, a post-test will determine if students met learning objectives</li>
<li>A satisfaction survey will assess learners' reactions to the program to assess the value of the training to the learners and to provide insight into possible adaptations to improve the program content and delivery in future iterations (Kirkpatrick, 1959)&nbsp;</li>
<li>A follow-up survey will be automatically generated at course completion and sent to course completers three months after completion to assess the impact the training has had on their community work</li>
