<h1>Introduction</h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a widening gap in the health of people living in rural and urban areas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ("About Rural Health," 2017; Atkins, Kim, &amp; Munson, 2017; Moy et al., 2017). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US Census Bureau defines “rural” as anything not urban and defines “urban” in two ways. Urbanized Areas (metropolitans) have populations of 50,000 or more. Urban Clusters (micropolitan) have populations of at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining Rural Population</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2021). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural populations are often in lower socio-economic strata, older, have higher smoking rates, higher blood pressure, and higher rates of obesity compared to urban populations ("About Rural Health," 2017). The mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, and stroke are higher among people in rural than urban areas (Atkins et al., 2017; Moy et al., 2017). Despite these statistics, rural health is often not prioritized because although approximately 63% of US counties are rural, only about 15% of the US population lives in rural areas (Paul, Arif, Adeyemi, Ghosh, &amp; Han, 2020).&nbsp; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different determinants of health, and different drivers of several shared determinants, between rural and urban populations (Downey, 2013). Both rural and urban populations experience health disparities along racial, educational attainment, experiences with adverse childhood events, and economical lines (Downey, 2013). However,&nbsp; social determinant differences between rural and urban populations in geography, occupational opportunities, infrastructure, demographic characteristics, access to care, social capital, and political voice exist and can lead to rural/urban health disparities (Downey, 2013). In addition to these social determinants, other drivers of rural/urban health disparities include differences in access to and affordability of healthcare, different behavioral patterns and lifestyles, cultural influences on health, and the environment (Downey, 2013). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While no population is homogenous, there is a tendency of people living in geographical communities to share similarities in culture and values. According to the National Center for Health Statistics’ analysis of registered voters by county, in 2017, urban counties were 62% Democrat (31% Republican) while rural counties were 54% Republican (38% Democrat)(PARKER et al., 2018). While younger generations may have more similar values than older generations, historically, people living in rural areas tend to align with conservative, Republican ideals of distrusting outsiders, self-reliance, independence, religion, familism, work orientation, stability, and fatalism (Balliet, Tybur, Wu, Antonellis, &amp; Van Lange, 2018; Dorfman, Murty, Evans, Ingram, &amp; Power, 2004; Smalley, Warren, &amp; Rainer, 2012; Stamm, 2003). Conversely, people living in urban areas tend to align with traditionally progressive, Democratic values including collective interest, egalitarianism, and advancement of social change (Balliet et al., 2018; Bodenheimer, 2005). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The overlay of political affiliation with health disparities is not coincidental. Beliefs, many exaggerated, ("Political Polarization: Often not as Bad as we Think," 2021) about what others value hinder many efforts to reduce health disparities. A conservative bias is that all individuals are motivated by self-interest and competition, and so one must out of self and family preservation (Balliet et al., 2018). A progressive bias is that conservatives are selfish and un-cooperative while progressives are generous and egalitarian (Balliet et al., 2018; Siegman &amp; Smith, 2013). In concert with differing social determinants and drivers of disparities, differing values and conformity to the values of ones’ community (Becker, Porter, &amp; Centola, 2019) help explain divisions among rural and urban populations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging and practicing public health professionals, policymakers, and the public must work together to reduce geopolitical divisions and disparities. Emerging and current public health professionals must understand differences in geopolitical health determinants and the drivers of these determinants, be experts at assessing and addressing the needs of diverse communities and engage in continual self-reflection to avoid perpetuating geo-political divisions that could stimy efforts to reduce disparities. Public health professionals must support health and prosperity for all, regardless of differences in race, class, gender, sex, political ideology, culture, social values, age, region, religion, and/or creed. Policymakers must likewise understand the needs and values of their constituencies and how these values, when enacted into policies, can promote or inhibit health equity.&nbsp; Finally, if geo-political divisions in the USA are to be addressed, the public must understand the fallacy of the “zero-sum” game, i.e., the idea that “gains” for the opposing political view are synonymous with “loss” for themselves.</span>
